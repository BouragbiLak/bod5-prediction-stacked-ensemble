> **"A High-Accuracy Stacked Ensemble Model for Predicting Effluent BOD₅ in Wastewater Treatment Plants Using Operational Data"**

The model uses a **stacked ensemble** of LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost with performance-based weighting (0.13, 0.75, 0.12) to predict effluent BOD₅ (BOD5_out) from routine operational data. Trained on **9 years of real-world data (2015–2024)** from a full-scale municipal WWTP in Skikda, Algeria, it achieves an exceptional **R² = 98.44%** and **MSE = 0.02**, outperforming individual models.

This work enables **real-time BOD₅ estimation**, transforming it from a delayed compliance check into a dynamic control variable for smarter wastewater management.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🧠 **Stacked Ensemble**: Combines LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost via weighted averaging.
- ⏳ **Time-Based Validation**: Chronological train/test split (80/20) ensures realistic forecasting performance.
- 🛠️ **Domain-Informed Feature Engineering**: 9 new features (e.g., COD removal efficiency, pH change, COD/BOD₅ ratio) improve interpretability and accuracy.
- 📊 **Robust Preprocessing**: Missing value handling, outlier removal (IQR) for BOD5_out, and temporal sorting.
- 🌐 **Deployable Soft Sensor**: Can be integrated into SCADA systems or used standalone.
